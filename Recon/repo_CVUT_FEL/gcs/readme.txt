This package contains a fast matching for binocular stereo via growing in
disparity space. The algorithm is described in: Jan Cech, Radim Sara:
Efficient Sampling of Disparity Space for Fast and Accurate Matching,
In Proc. BenCOS CVPR Workshop, 2007 and is also available from
http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~cechj

Please refer to that article if you are publishing results based on
this toolbox.

This version contains some unpublished improvements, which
increase the density of the resulting disparity map.

Run test_gcs to test functionality and learn how to run the main
module.
